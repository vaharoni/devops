# The file structure is as follows:
#
# <image-name>:
#   docker-file: <name-of-dockerfile>
#   debug-template: <debug-template>
#   applications:
#   - <application-name>
#   - <application-name>
#
# Where:
# <image-name>          The name of the image. Github action should refer to this name in a hard-coded manner when invoking devops scripts.
# <name-of-dockerfile>  Name of the dockerfile in .devops/docker-images
# <debug-template>      Each image comes with a debug pod that can be acccessed as a console. This is the name of the manifest to use. Only "debug-console" is currently supported.
# applications          List of applications that use this image. There is no need to specify dependencies - they will be derived as long as they are declared in package.json.
