# Prisma (Python)

Assume all existing prisma migrations are applied, hence never change existing migrations.

NEVER reset the development database without permission.

As you know, Prisma is not good at renaming, so after creating migrations automatically from schema changes always go over the migrations and make sure it captured the user intent.

## Commands

All prisma commands should be executed via the devopspy CLI:

```bash
./devopspy prisma <some command>
./devopspy prisma migrate dev
```

To generate the Prisma client after schema changes:

```bash
./devopspy run db:generate
```

## DB Package

The prisma schema resides in `db/prisma/schema.prisma`. To use the Prisma client from any application, add `db` as a workspace dependency in your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
db = { workspace = true }
```

Then import as usual:

```python
from db import prisma
```

## Schema Conventions

When editing Prisma schemas:

- Define new models with singular PascalCase names and map them to plural snake_case table names via `@@map`.
- All table columns should remain in snake_case using `@map` on each field when needed.
- Default primary keys should be `String @id @default(cuid())` unless there is an explicit reason to use another strategy.
- Add `@default(now())` + `@map("created_at")` for creation timestamps and `@default(now()) @updatedAt @map("updated_at")` for update timestamps.
- Always create an index (`@@index`) for every relational field to keep lookups performant.
- Prefer Prisma's default column type mapping; use `@db.*` annotations only when you truly need a non-default database type.
- Prefer lowercase values for enums we fully control (e.g., `pending`, `completed` instead of `PENDING`, `COMPLETED`).
- Prefer strings rather than enums for data-driven closed-lists unless the user requests otherwise.
