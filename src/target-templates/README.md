This folder contains the templates that are copied to the target project's folder based on answers the user provides during `./devops init`. Some of these answers may change the content of files, which is done by substituting variables prefixed by `$`. To avoid potential issues, such substitution is not pursued globally for all files in this folder. Files requiring substitution must be referenced by name in `./devops init` code.
