This documentation is TBD.

Intended topics:
- How to add apps and libs (don't forget to set up `images.yaml`)
- How to install packages inside apps and libs (`devops exec --in appname bun add somepackage`)
- How to deploy (push to `staging` or `production`)
- How to set up environment variables (`devops env` for remote, `config/.env*` files for local)
- How to check logs (`kubectl logs`)
- How to get a debug console (`devops console`)
- How to work with python (poetry, the need for `package.json` to play nicely with `devops`)
